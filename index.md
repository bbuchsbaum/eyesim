## Overview

Are two eye-movement fixation patterns similar? The goal of the `eyesim`
package is to provide methods for answering this question.

For example, in studies of recognition memory, we might ask whether the
eye-movement fixation pattern during the first presentation of an image
(“encoding”) is similar to the eye-movement fixation pattern during the
second presentation of the same image (“recognition”). Furthermore, we
can ask whether fixation similarity varies as a function of conditions
in the experimental design or the behavioral responses (e.g. correct
recognition or miss).

## Vignettes

With some luck you might be able to make a cool image like the one
