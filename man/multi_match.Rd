\title{Compute MultiMatch Metrics for Scanpath Similarity}
\usage{
multi_match(x, y, screensize)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame representing the first scanpath. Must contain at least three columns: \code{x}, \code{y}, and \code{onset}, and at least three rows.}

\item{y}{A data frame representing the second scanpath. Must contain at least three columns: \code{x}, \code{y}, and \code{onset}, and at least three rows.}

\item{screensize}{A numeric vector of length 2 indicating the width and height of the screen in pixels.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector with the following elements:
\describe{
  \item{mm_vector}{Similarity based on the 2D vectors between fixations.}
  \item{mm_direction}{Similarity based on the direction (angle) of saccades between fixations.}
  \item{mm_length}{Similarity based on the length of saccades between fixations.}
  \item{mm_position}{Similarity based on the spatial position of fixations.}
  \item{mm_duration}{Similarity based on the duration of fixations.}
  \item{mm_position_emd}{Order-insensitive similarity based on the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between the spatial positions of fixations.}
}
}
\description{
This function computes multiple similarity metrics between two scanpaths, including vector, direction, length, position, duration, and EMD-based position similarity.
}
\details{
The function computes six different similarity metrics between the scanpaths \code{x} and \code{y}:
\itemize{
  \item \code{mm_vector}: Similarity based on the 2D vectors between fixations.
  \item \code{mm_direction}: Similarity based on the direction (angle) of saccades between fixations.
  \item \code{mm_length}: Similarity based on the length of saccades between fixations.
  \item \code{mm_position}: Similarity based on the spatial position of fixations.
  \item \code{mm_duration}: Similarity based on the duration of fixations.
  \item \code{mm_position_emd}: Order-insensitive similarity based on the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between the spatial positions of fixations.
}

The function ensures that both scanpaths have strictly increasing onset times and contain at least three fixations. It also normalizes the similarity scores to lie between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating greater similarity.

# Example usage:
scanpath1 <- data.frame(x = runif(10, 0, 500), y = runif(10, 0, 500), onset = cumsum(runif(10, 1, 5)))
scanpath2 <- data.frame(x = runif(10, 0, 500), y = runif(10, 0, 500), onset = cumsum(runif(10, 1, 5)))
screensize <- c(500, 500)
similarity_scores <- multi_match(scanpath1, scanpath2, screensize)
print(similarity_scores)
